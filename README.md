# vlog2_sudoku

One day I developed an algorithm that made sudoku boring to me.  In this video I will share my algorithm to solve most sudoku quickly and correctly, purely by hand and mind without any help from computer.  However as an added bonus I've also shared the source code to solve sudoku.  It was written in in Turbo Pascal, long long time ago in faraway land.  

But you can port it to Delphi, with minimal effort, anyway...  In my video, I use ported source code in Delphi for demonstration purposes, as Turbo Pascal doesn't work on modern Windows system.
